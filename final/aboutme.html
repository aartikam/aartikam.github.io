	<div id="box-1" class="boxes">I grew up surrounded by music, dance, and classic films. I am trained in classical piano theory and technique, and spent my high school years spreading my love for the art as a piano teacher. Dance has also been a passion of mine for a long time. I've been prancing on stages since the tender age of four, having trained in ballet, tap, jazz, contemporary, and Bollywood styles.  </div>
	<div id="box-2" class="boxes">There is such beauty and grandeur in the great outdoors. I love being outside and soaking up the sunshine, going on hikes, and simply enjoying Mother Nature's creations. This has led me to explore the sandy beaches of Carmel, the gardens at Versailles, and lush foliage of Bombay. There is nothing quite like the smell of that first autumn rain.</div>
	<div id="box-3" class="boxes">I have a very soft corner in my heart for animals. I have two sweet maltipoos back home, who have inspired me to help animals in need. I helped establish a club on campus dedicated to serving shelter animals and continue to volunteer at the shelter in my free time. Zoos and aquariums are my happy place.</div>
	<div id="box-4" class="boxes">While I was born in India, I spent most of my upbringing in the sunny Fremont, California. I went on to study Biology and Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. The Bay Area has been my home for the last eighteen years, and I am so thankful for the adventures and the friendly people. I left my heart in San Francisco, where it will forever reside. What can I say, California girls, we're unforgettable!</div>
